The project focuses on designing and implementing a database to manage university-related data, including courses, facilities, and student information.
It involves creating a UML diagram to conceptualize the database structure, translating this into a relational data model, and ensuring the design adheres to normalization standards to avoid redundancy and anomalies. 
The database aims to support various operations like course registration, exam scheduling, and space reservations, providing a comprehensive solution for academic administration.
